# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm install`

Then start the application by running:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can trigger unit tests by running:

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Time taken to implement

It took nearly,

* ~3 to 3.5 hours to complete all the functional requirements
* ~3 hours for unit tests (Just learnt and implemented tests - so it took sometime)
* ~3 hours for Final CSS beautification (Took some time because I had to think and come up with the designs and then implement those)
